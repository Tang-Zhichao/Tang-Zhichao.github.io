Abstract:
In this paper,  we prove that for any smooth hypersurface $Y$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}_k$, the cyclic $d$-fold cover $\widetilde{Y} \to \mathbb{P}^{n+1}_k$ branched along $Y$ completely characterizes $Y$ up to projective equivalence. This solves a question asked by Huybrechts in [[Huy23](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009280020), $\S \mathbf{1}.5.6$].
