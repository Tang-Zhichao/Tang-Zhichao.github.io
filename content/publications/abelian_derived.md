Abstract:
In this paper, we establish a derived Torelli Theorem for twisted abelian varieties. Starting from this, we explore the relation between derived isogenies and classical isogenies.  We show that two abelian varieties of dimension $\geq 2$ are derived isogenous if and only if they are principally isogenous over fields of characteristic zero. This generalized the result for abelian surfaces and completely solves the question raised in [LZ25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08710).
