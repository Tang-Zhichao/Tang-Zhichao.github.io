In autumn of 2025, one of the topics of the learning seminar is the boundedness and b-semiampleness conjecture.
Recent progress on these topics (check the notes for details) make use of o-minimality,
which is a notion from model theory.

Here is some notes on o-minimality.
Currently these topics are not covered,
and future changes may occur when these are covered in the seminar.
